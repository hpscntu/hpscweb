- title: "A Heterogeneous Computing Framework for Accelerating Fully Homomorphic Encryption"
  image: imageaward_edited.png
  description: This framework encompasses homomorphic evaluations on multiple platforms including CPU, GPU, and FPGA, paired with a tailored task scheduling algorithm. Each platform is equipped with comprehensive FHE functionalities and employs state-of-the-art imple- mentations, allowing for standalone evaluation of FHE applications.

  image: 9925707.gif
  description: The advance of nonvolatile memory in storage technology has presented challenges in redefining the ways in handling the main memory and the storage. This work is motivated by the strong demands in effective handling of page faults over ultralow-latency storage devices. In particular, we propose synchronous and asynchronous prefetching strategies to satisfy process executions with different memory demands in supporting of synchronous page fault handling. An adaptive CPU scheduling strategy is also proposed to cope with the needs of processes in maintaining their working sets in the main memory. Six representative benchmarks and applications were evaluated. It was shown that our strategy can effectively save 12.33% of the total execution time and reduce 13.33% of page faults, compared to the conventional demand paging strategy with nearly no sacrificing of process fairness.
